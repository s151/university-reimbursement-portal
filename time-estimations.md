## 🎯 Scope of Work Done

Though the initial estimate covered only the core requirement (basic form + backend), I chose to build a more complete solution that simulates a production-ready app.

The following features contributed to the additional effort:

- 🔐 **Secure login & registration system**
- 👤 **Role-based access** with separate flows for employees and admins
- 🛠️ **Admin dashboard** to view, approve, and reject reimbursements
- 📄 **Form validations and file uploads**
- 🗃️ **Database schema** in SQL Server with normalized relationships
- 🎨 **Thoughtfully styled UI** for clear and smooth interaction
- 🔄 **Robust testing & edge case handling** for reliable performance

These extra hours reflect my dedication to:
- Designing an intuitive user experience
- Maintaining backend integrity
- Delivering a high-quality solution rather than a rushed prototype
