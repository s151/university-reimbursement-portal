# ðŸ’¡ Reasons for Choosing the Tech Stack

---

I selected **Angular + .NET Core Web API + SQL Server** because this stack offered the right blend of productivity, structure, and scalability for the given problem.

## âœ… Why Angular for the Frontend?

Angular enabled me to:

- Build a **multi-step login/registration system** using form modules.
- Create a **dynamic reimbursement submission form** with validations.
- Implement **conditional routing and access control** for admins vs. employees.
- Structure the app using **modular components**, services, and guards â€” ensuring maintainability.

## âœ… Why ASP.NET Core Web API for the Backend?

- High-performance, flexible, and well-integrated with SQL Server.
- Provided secure and RESTful APIs for:
  - Login, registration, and role validation
  - Reimbursement submission and approvals
  - File upload/download
- Used **Entity Framework with LINQ** to easily interact with the DB.

## âœ… Why SQL Server?

- Relational structure matched the normalized schema needed for members, claims, and documents.
- Strong integration with .NET, reliable local setup, and schema constraints helped enforce data integrity.

This tech stack empowered me to deliver a **fully functional, production-grade system** â€” balancing speed and quality while building everything from scratch.
